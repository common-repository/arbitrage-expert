<p>Cryptocurrency arbitrage expert widget WordPress plugin displays arbitrage opportunities in real time between 9000 crypto coins - bitcoin, ethereum, ripple, litecoin etc.</p>

<p><strong>Cryptocurrency arbitrage</strong> refers to buying digital currency on a crypto exchange where the price is significantly lower & simultaneously selling the coins at an digital exchange where the prices are substantially higher, as result profiting from a difference in crypto prices. The <u>prices of cryptocurrency</u> may vary from one exchange to the next, because the markets are not inter connected. The difference in supply & demand across many exchanges can result in price fluctuation. Sometimes it may take a long time for prices to finally adjust to global average. </p>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
<h4>Can I display real time live price changes?</h4>
<p>Absolutely! We don't bother intergrading 3rd party API like Coinmarketcap, due to limited and delayed data, instead the data is fetched directly from an exchange every 30 seconds. We also use web hooks where possible.</p>

<h4>Can I set another default pair to be displayed to my visitors?</h4>
<p>Unfortunately not. Since the price table is displayed in an iframe, there are no settings that would allow configuring this, however it will be considered in the future versions.</p> 

<h4>Can I display arbitrage expert widget anywhere?</h4>
<p>YES, you can easily display cryptocurrency arbitrage expert in header, footer or anywhere inside your website using simple shortcodes. A unique shortcode will be generated automatically when you will create a new arbitrage widget.</p>
